Altered Beast Arcade Voices patch
=================================

This patch replaces the voice samples in Altered Beast with data taken from the original arcade game, played using high-quality pcmenc data. It also adds in the missing "Rise from your grave", "Never give up" and "Welcome to your doom" samples, and the different beast roars.
