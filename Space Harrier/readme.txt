Space Harrier Arcade Voices patch
=================================

This patch replaces the voice samples in Space Harrier with data taken from the original arcade game, played using high-quality pcmenc data. The "Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, Get Ready" sample is also added at the start of the game; and the "You're Doing Great" sample is added between stages.

Make sure to patch the "50Hz and 60Hz" version of the game. The 50Hz variant is not supported.
